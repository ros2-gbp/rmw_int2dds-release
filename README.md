# int2dds_ffi_vendor

ROS 2 vendor package that fetches the **prebuilt int2DDS FFI library** for the
host platform at build time and exposes it to colcon/ament as an imported CMake
target. It is the dependency boundary between the Rust `int2DDS` core (shipped as
prebuilt binaries) and the C++ `rmw_int2dds_cpp` middleware.

## What it does

1. Detects the host OS, architecture, and libc (gnu/musl).
2. Downloads the per-OS release asset from the
   [int2dds_ffi_vendor releases](https://github.com/IntellectusCorp/int2dds_ffi_vendor/releases)
   page. That repository is the artifact host; this package's source lives in
   `rmw_int2dds`.
3. Reads the bundled manifest, selects the artifact matching the host, and
   verifies its sha256.
4. Installs `int2dds-ffi.h` + the platform shared library as `include/` + `lib/`.
5. Exports the imported target `int2dds_ffi::int2dds_ffi`.

## Consuming it (downstream)

```cmake
find_package(int2dds_ffi_vendor REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_target int2dds_ffi::int2dds_ffi)
```

```xml
<!-- package.xml -->
<depend>int2dds_ffi_vendor</depend>
```

## Release asset layout

One tarball per OS is published on the `int2dds_ffi_vendor` release tagged
`v${INT2DDS_FFI_VERSION}` (see [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt)). Each tarball
bundles every architecture for that OS plus a manifest. Each architecture
directory carries the real library plus the usual SONAME symlink chain:

```
int2dds-ffi-<version>-linux.tar.gz
├── int2dds-ffi.h                              # C API header
├── int2dds-ffi.manifest.yaml                  # per-arch file + sha256 + soname + min_glibc
├── LICENSE

├── linux-x86_64-musl/                         # amd64, musl
├── linux-aarch64/                             # arm64, gnu
├── linux-aarch64-musl/                        # arm64, musl
└── linux-armhf/                               # armv7, gnu
```

`int2dds-ffi.manifest.yaml`:

```yaml
name: int2dds-ffi
version: 0.1.1
artifacts:
  - os: linux
    arch: amd64
    triple: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
    file: linux-x86_64/libint2dds_ffi.so.0.1.1
    soname: libint2dds_ffi.so.0
    sha256: <hex>
    min_glibc: "2.34"
  ...
```

The `file:` value must match `<subdir>/libint2dds_ffi.so.${INT2DDS_FFI_VERSION}`
exactly — that is the key the vendor package looks up to find the expected
`sha256`. If it does not match, verification is skipped with a warning instead
of failing.

Because the manifest already carries per-artifact `sha256`, the vendor package
verifies integrity automatically — no SHA values need to be hard-coded here.

### libc selection

The default is glibc (`gnu`), which is what ROS binaries target (Ubuntu 22.04
Jammy ships glibc 2.35 ≥ the artifacts' `min_glibc: 2.34`). For a musl host:

```bash
colcon build --cmake-args -DINT2DDS_FFI_LIBC=musl
```

`armhf` ships only a gnu build.

### Building against a locally built FFI

`INT2DDS_FFI_TARBALL` replaces the download with a tarball you already have —
normally the one the int2DDS tree just produced:

```bash
colcon build --cmake-args \
  -DINT2DDS_FFI_TARBALL=/path/to/int2DDS/ffi/dist/int2dds-ffi-0.1.1-linux.tar.gz
```

Two reasons to reach for it. The obvious one is offline builds. The other is
that the release tag does not identify the ABI: the `v0.1.1` assets were rebuilt
in place, so two different `int2dds-ffi.h` files have shipped under that one
version, and because the manifest is rebuilt along with them the sha256 check
cannot separate the two either. Naming the file is the only way to be sure which
build you linked against.

Integrity checking is unchanged — the manifest travels inside the tarball, so the
selected library is still verified. The tarball must carry the library soname for
`INT2DDS_FFI_VERSION`; a version mismatch fails with `artifact not found`.

Building this package and `rmw_int2dds_cpp` in one `colcon` invocation makes
CMake warn that `INT2DDS_FFI_TARBALL` went unused — `--cmake-args` reaches every
selected package, and only this one reads the variable. The warning is harmless.

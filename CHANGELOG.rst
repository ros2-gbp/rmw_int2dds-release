Changelog for package int2dds_ffi_vendor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.1.4 (2026-09-04)
------------------
* Vendor the int2DDS FFI 0.1.4 release assets in place of 0.1.3. The C API is
  unchanged: the published ``int2dds-ffi.h`` differs only in added safety
  documentation, every declaration is identical. The libraries are a fresh
  build of int2DDS ``d600e70``, so the sha256 of every artifact moved.
* The glibc floor is unchanged (2.28 on x86_64 and aarch64, 2.34 on armhf) and
  so is the soname, ``libint2dds_ffi.so.0``.

0.1.3 (2026-09-02)
------------------
* Vendor the int2DDS FFI 0.1.3 release assets in place of 0.1.1. The published
  ``v0.1.3`` tarball ships the same ``int2dds-ffi.h`` as its git tag, so the
  version string identifies the ABI again; the ``v0.1.1`` assets had been
  rebuilt in place under one version and did not.
* Lower the glibc floor from 2.34 to 2.28 on x86_64 and aarch64, widening the
  set of hosts the prebuilt artifact runs on. armhf stays at 2.34 and the musl
  builds are unaffected.
* The soname is unchanged at ``libint2dds_ffi.so.0``.
* Contributors: Intellectus Corp.

0.1.1 (2026-08-28)
------------------
* Move the package into the ``rmw_int2dds`` repository, next to
  ``rmw_int2dds_cpp``, so the two are released in lockstep. The prebuilt FFI
  tarballs are still published on the ``int2dds_ffi_vendor`` release page and
  are downloaded and sha256-verified at CMake configure time, unchanged.
